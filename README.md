# SLAE

Repository for the assignments for the SLAE exam. 

Use the 'compile.sh'-script in the repository root to compile and generate the shellcode wrapper, except for Assignment3, in which there is a compile script in the assignment folder that needs to be used. 

The blog posts for the exam can be found here: https://rtmcx.github.io/
